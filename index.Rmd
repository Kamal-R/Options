# Preface {-}

## Acknowledgments {-}

This book is written in Rmarkdown using the _bookdown_ package, hosted on Netlify, and built using Travis CI. The _Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown_ at https://musing-aryabhata-b16338.netlify.com/ was very helpful in setting up Netlify and Travis CI.
